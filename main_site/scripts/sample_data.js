    The game is created using Unity, allowing for stunning graphics and immersive gameplay. But what sets it apart is the use of Livepeer video streaming technology, which enables real-time communication between players and game developers. This means that players can receive personalized guidance and support, making their gaming experience more engaging and interactive.

    With its compelling storyline, stunning visuals, and innovative use of technology, this video game promises to be an unforgettable gaming experience for players. So grab your controller and get ready to join John on his quest to save humanity!`, "collabs": ["Parmida Saghafi"], "img_url":'icons/SOR_icon.svg', "url": "null"},

The main technical points were to integrate the unity3D game engine with the livepeer video streaming API. After seeing the livepeer presentation, we were inspired by the idea of a game that leveraged a decentralized video hosting source. Within the game the player prepares for a long day of investigating the Mayors sudden disappearance. After analyzing the video clip evidence, strange occurrences happen around the office, you decide to take a closer look into what's causing these bizarre events. This game uses Livepeer's REST API and decentralized video storage/streaming to store and present the mystery scenes in real time to enrich the story. It uses a combination of Unity's 3D rendering systems with the video streaming power of Livepeer's open source REST API.`, "collabs": ["Yousif El-Wishahy", "Parmida Saghafi"], "img_url":'icons/missing_mystery.svg', "url": "null"},
