          <textarea id="contents" name="contents" rows="50" cols="100">As a person who is fascinated by the possibilities of emerging technologies, By joining your team, I will contribute my experience with Python and C, as well as my web development skills. Therefore, my experiences of developing web applications, my exceptional communication, system administration skills, contributions to SFU Satellite Design, and self motivation with projects would be beneficial for this position.
As a Team Lead and prior Co-Lead for the Mission Operations Subteam at SFU Satellite Design, I am tasked with designing and assisting with building the user workflow that defines the core mission of the satellite and providing a way for amateur radio operators and general public to easily access the satellite securely. Using my experiences with Python and experience with web APIs, we developed a GRPC driver that provides a high level programming interface for TypeScript to call and send commands to a Python OBCPy driver which send the commands directly to the prototype satellite via serial communication. Additionally, Figma is used to design the high quality UI mockups which outline the user interfaces and methods to safely interact with the satellite. These contributions ensure that when the satellite is deployed into low Earth orbit that the primary objective of ALEASAT is done in an interactive way, as the prior solution were to document using spreadsheets. 
I developed web applications for the Department of Education at SFU that take education spreadsheet data from a server and convert it from comma separated values into a interactive data visualization app. All of the functionality is done at the front-end. It allows the user to interactively zoom in and out of the map and look around in real-time. Users can filter through options such as the Author, location, region, funder and other attributes. One version also displays information in the form of cards on the left side and allows them to view pictures and descriptions about the study. It is paired with a tabulated manager web application to allow for easy management of data points managed by the backend. The frontend communicates with the Node.js backend in order to retrieve data points for display. This provides researchers the ability to see research in a whole different way, as opposed to looking through spreadsheets. 
Additionally, my experience as an IT Support Technician at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC allows for the demonstration of crucial soft skills such as excellent collaboration and communication skills. During the course of my time there, I have resolved an average of 20+ tickets per week, retained excellent user satisfaction and helped discover an efficient solution to obtaining department wide emails across the College. By contrast, the suggested solution is to email every single department head and anticipate a reply from them. The automatic solution I implemented traverses the Active Directory tree and prints out every single email existing in the system and logs them into a text file. I sent this file to the Director of Communications and she was highly satisfied and complete in less than a day. 
I am eager to provide the teamwork skills, programming skills and aptitude needed to support and ensure success in this position. By providing you with my skills and experiences, it provides the opportunity to learn more about new and emerging technologies and how I can apply my design and computing experience to support your endeavours and how they can be used to solve real world problems. I also ensure that any projects that I am entrusted to work become successful. I appreciate you taking the time to review my application and I look forward to an interview with you.
